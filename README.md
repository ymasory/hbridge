# Welcome to HBridge! #

## What is HBridge? ##

HBridge unlocks the rich functionality of HBase for a Scala audience.
In so doing, it attempts to achieve the following goals:

- Provide a strong, clear syntax for querying and filtration
- Perform as fast as possible while maintaining idiomatic Scala client code --
  the abstractions should not show up in a profiler!
- Re-articulate HBase's data structures rather than force it into an ORM-style
  atmosphere.
- Use Scala's type system to its advantage--the compiler should verify the
  integrity of the schema.
- Be a verbose DSL--minimize boilerplate code, but be human readable!

## Project Status ##

This project is currently actively developed and maintained.
It is used in a large production codebase in high-throughput, memory-intensive
scenarios, and has many months of bug fixes under its belt.
Because it already has a great deal of code utilizing it, there will not be many
breaking changes to the API.
Instead what we usually do is provide an upgraded API that sits next to the old
API, then deprecate the old one.

## Installation ##

- sbt based dependency setup
  ```
  resolvers ++= Seq("CphyLabs-Repo" at "http://cphylabs.github.com/hbridge/repository")

  ```

## Quickstart ##

This library is composed of 2 simple abstractions:

1. `HBridgeConfig`
  - This class is a clean abstraction of Hadoop Configuration class (including
    and not limited to ZKQuorum, ZKPort, HMaster , etc)
  - All properties pertaining to HBase client access can be composed in a
    externalized YAML properties file and loaded during client startup
  - Example:
    ```scala
    val zkQuorum = config.getString("hbaseZookeeperQuorum").get
    val zkClientPort = config.getString("hbaseZookeeperClientPort").get
    val hbaseWriteBuffer = config.getString("hbaseWriteBufferSize").get
    val hbaseMaster = config.getString("hbaseMaster").get
    val hbridgeConfig = HBridgeConfig(zkQuorum, zkClientPort, hbaseWriteBuffer, hbaseMaster)
    ```
1. `HBridge`
  - This class is a clean abstraction over `HTable` (both in DDL and DML
    perspective)
  - After successfully acquiring HBridgeConfig
    ```scala
    def withHbase(hbridgeConfig: HBridgeConfig,
      rowKey: String,
      tableName: String,
      cfName: String,
      cqName: String,
      cqinventoryPoolSize: Int,
      chunkSize: Int)(f: (HBridge, String, String, String) => Unit) {
        val hbridge = HBridge(hbridgeConfig, tableName)
        hbridge.setAutoFlush(false)
        try {
        f(hbridge, rowKey, cfName, cqName)
        } finally {
        hbridge.commit // Add a COMMIT only for write operations and NOT for READ (FETCH) operations
        hbridge.returnToPool
        log.info("Returned to Pool")
        -- optionally tear down when done (Preferably don't close the pool in web application server that run in
        -- continuous mode
        hbridge.closeTablePool(tableName)
        }
    }
    ```
  - Now use this function as illustrated below
    ```scala
    withHbase(
      hbridgeConfig,
      rowKey,
      historyTableName,
      historyCF,
      fileQualifier,
      inventoryPoolSize,
      chunkSize
    ) { (hbridge, rowKey, cf, cq) =>
      hbridge.put(rowKey, cf, cq, value)
      hbridge.scanRow ....
    }
    ```
